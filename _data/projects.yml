    This project was my first dive into web developement with <mark>Angular</mark>.
    Angular is a single page web development front end framework.
    The shopping website uses <mark>Firebase</mark> as a Back-End to manage its data.
    The Front-End styling uses <mark>Bootstrap</mark>, an open source toolkit for building responsive websites.
    This website can be found at the above URL. The code base can be found by clicking on the GitHub icon. In order to get the full shopping experience,
    don't forget to Login.

    Microscope was built using <mark>Meteor</mark>. Meteor, unlike Angular, is a Full-Stack <mark>JavaScript</mark> framework built on top of <mark>Node.js</mark>.
    This framework allows for beginners like me to build reactive applications with a minimum learning curve.
    Microscope's Front-End is built with <mark>React</mark>, and its data store uses <mark>MongoDB</mark>.
    Microscope demonstrats a few patterns such as creating Posts, Comments, Voting, and Notifications. In order to access all the features of Microscope, don't forget to sign in.

    Chat-App is a basic environment to allow users to communicate. It was built in <mark>Angular9</mark> using
    <mark>Angular Material UI component library</mark>,
    <mark>TypeScript</mark>, <mark>Firebase Realtime Database</mark>
    as the Back-End, and also hosted with <mark>Firebase</mark>.
    The app contains 4 pages:
    - Login
    - RoomList : To show the rooms that already added.
    - AddRooms: To add a room.
    - ChatRoom : This is the page that users would be able to write messages and communicate to each other.

#    - ChatNavBarComponent : Will contain the unread messages count.
#    - ChatThreadsComponent : Will show a clickable list of threads, along with the most recent message and the conversation avatar.
#    - ChatWindowComponent : Will show the messages in the current thread with an input box to send new messages.
