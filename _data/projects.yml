    I started this project as a way of learning <mark>Angular</mark> since it is a framework for building single-page client applications. Shopping Website built with <mark>Firebase</mark> and <mark>Bootstrap</mark> to build a real-time serverless application. You can log in and start ordering.

    Microscope is a project that I lerned <mark>Meteor</mark> which is a platform built on top of <mark>Node.js</mark> for building real-time web apps. Since it is build on Node.js, Metor uses <mark>JavaScript</mark> on both the client and on the server. The result of all this is a platform that manages to be very powerful and very simple by abstracting away many of the usual hassles and pitfalls of web app development. This application is in Meteor using <mark>React</mark> and store data in <mark>MongoDB</mark> and demonstrating a few patterns such as creating posts, comments, voting, and etc. In order to access all the features you would need to sign in.
